      Georgia is a mountainous country, surrounded from the north by the peaks
      of the

      Greater Caucasus range. This relatively small nation is characterized by diversity 
       - with the Black Sea as her western border, the Lesser Caucasus range to the south, and vast valleys and steppes to behold in the east.

    title: UNIQUE WINE
    text: >
      Georgia is the birthplace of wine. On this land our ancestors began
      cultivating grapes as early as 8000 year ago. The Georgian method of
      making wine, that is, in clay amphorae called “kvevri”, is listed by
      UNESCO as a global cultural heritage. Georgians continue these practices
      to this day, and traditional kvevri wine can be found anywhere.

    title: RICH CULTURAL LEGACY
    text: >
      Georgia adopted Christianity in the 4th century AD, which has resulted in
      an

      abundance of ancient sacral edifices all over the country – some being UNESCO

      monuments. But Orthodox churches aren’t the only thing Georgia can show off.

      There are also medieval centres of education and culture, academies, fortified towers and castles, cave-cities, as well as monuments hailing back to pagan times.

### **Sakartvelo** (საქართველო)

That’s what the name of Georgia sounds like in our native tongue. How can we best
describe her? There’s a myriad of things to be said: with Georgia being one of the
world’s oldest civilizations, the first Georgian kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia already
existed in antiquity. Georgia is tied to Greek mythology as well – it is here that the
legendary Argonauts came in search of the Golden Fleece. She is also home to the
oldest Europeans: the most ancient human remains in Europe were discovered on
Georgian soil. And in 2017 our country was officially deemed the birthplace of wine –
rightly so, given that we boast an over 8000-year old wine-making tradition! We also
mustn’t forget that Georgia adopted Christianity in the 4th century AD, becoming the
second country in the world to do so.
