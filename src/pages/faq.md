      Yes! Perhaps you heard something about a war with Russia or civil
      conflict, but that was all a long time ago. Georgia is now a very safe and
      tourism-oriented place. Statistics show that from 2017 onwards Georgia is
      visited by 7-9 million visitors annually, so twice the amount of people
      actually living in the country!
    question: Is Georgia safe?
  - answer: >
      The tourist season in Georgia starts at the beginning of April and lasts
      till October – not considering of course the ski season from December to
      March. Summer in Georgia is much hotter than in many places in Europe. The
      standard summer temperature stand at +30°C, while in August it
      occasionally even surpasses +35°C. One should also remember that the
      climate is quite varied – the western part of the

      country is subtropical, while the eastern territories are dry and temperate. Aside from that, Georgia is surrounded by mountains, where, naturally, the temperature is colder than in the lower-lying areas.
    question: When is the best time to visit Georgia?
  - question: What’s the climate like in Georgia?
    answer: "Given the highly varied terrain, Georgia’s climate is very diverse. The
      western side of the country, bordering the Black Sea, is subtropical,
      which causes the heaviest annual rainfall (4000 mm). The eastern side is
      characterized by a dry temperate climate with a low level of rainfall (200
      mm). Temperatures during the hot summers can reach upwards of +35°C.
      Winters are mild, with lowland temperatures not falling below - 8°C ,
      though the mountains of the Greater Caucasus have harsh winters with
      temperatures as low as -20°C and heavy snowfalls. This makes them suitable
      for a functioning ski resort industry. The flora is also very diverse: the
      west sports figs, palm trees, laurels, olives, citrus fruits, kiwis, and
      other Mediterranean plants; the east allows for the large-scale
      cultivation of grapes."

      Bring comfortable clothing and forget all the silly blogs recommending
      that you cover your shoulders and knees. Dress however will be most
      comfortable to you. Just remember, we’ll also be visiting the mountains,
      so some warmer clothing will come in handy along with comfy footwear. Have
      a raincoat handy as well. Ladies should have a headscarf at the ready for
      entering churches. Most often shawls will be available for borrowing at
      entrances to temples, but having your own won’t hurt.
    question: How should I dress for the trip?
  - answer: >
      It doesn’t matter, just remember not to convert your currency to the
      Georgian lari at home, as Georgia has better exchange rates locally. Also
      remember that if you do bring USD along, take newer notes – in Georgia
      most exchanges won’t accept older USD bills from before 2011.
    question: Is it better to bring EUR or USD?
  - answer: >+
      Prices are comparable to those in Central Europe. The exchange rate stands
      at around 1 GEL (Georgian lari) being 0.30 EUR. The price of a souvenir
      ranges between 1 and 20 lari. A bottle of good wine will come to 15-20
      lari or more. Beers/coffee on the town will cost around 6-7 lari. It’s
      possible to pay by card in most places, and ATMs can be found virtually
      everywhere. One should remember that foreign currencies aren’t accepted in
      Georgia, payments can only be made in lari (in cash) or by card.

    question: How much money should I take? Is Georgia a cheap country?
  - question: Can I pay by card locally?
    answer: In larger cities and towns most food, stay, and shopping localities will
      accept card payments. Cards won’t be accepted at bazaars, open-air
      souvenir stalls, small cafes on-route, in mountain villages, etc. Most
      ATMs in Georgia accept cards issued by European banks, and Georgian laris
      can be withdrawn.
  - answer: >-
      Remember that the bacterial flora in Georgia is different and each
      individual stomach may react to it in a different way. Bring along any
      medicine that may help with potential stomach problems. If you forget to
      do so don’t fret, pharmacies are all over the place, and most medicines in
      Georgia are over the counter. To avoid issues at the airport, make sure
      that none of the medicine on your person contains codeine. In

      Georgia codeine is classified as a narcotic and it’s importation into the country, in any form, is illegal. Sunscreen will also come in handy, as the Georgian sun is often fierce, and not only at the beach.
    question: Should I bring any medicine?
  - answer: >
      Since 2011 citizens of Schengen zone countries can enter Georgia on the
      basis of their ID, if it’s valid for at least 3 months from the date of
      entry. Remember that if you are signed up for a trip that also includes
      Armenia and Azerbaijan, you have to come with your passport. Entry on the
      basis of ID is only permitted by Georgia.
    question: What documents are required for entering the country?
  - answer: EU citizens can enter and stay in Georgia and Armenia for the purpose of
      tourism without any visa. Azerbaijan requires a visa from EU citizens, but
      it’s issuing is very simple. The application for an Azerbaijani visa is
      submitted online (https://evisa.gov.az/), the fee is paid via transfer,
      and the electronic visa is sent to your e-mail. When crossing the border
      into Azerbaijan, you will have to show your passport and your printed-out
      e-visa. The price of the visa is 24 USD.
